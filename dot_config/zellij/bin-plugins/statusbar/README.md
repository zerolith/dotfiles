## Installation
I didn't publish it anywhere, so you can pull this repo and build it from source.

Checkout [my install script](../../../script/install.sh) and [zellij config](../../../home/.config/zellij/) for details.

NOTE: On the first run, `zellij` asks the permission to run the plugin. Navigate to the plagin pane (it should be selectable) and hit `y`. You might need to restart the session for plugin to function properly.
